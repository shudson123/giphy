This webpage allows the user to click on buttons with the names of rock bands, which then renders a set of 10 gifs relating to the band, as well as a rating for each gif.
The gifs are pulled from the website www.giphy.com by use of API.
The user also has the option to type in the name of a band and click submit, which will then create a button of that band next to the premade buttons.
The user can also click on the new buttons to generate 10 gifs and ratings.
Reloading the page deletes the displayed gifs, as well as the buttons that they made.
This website is accessible to any major browser, although google chrome is preferable.
